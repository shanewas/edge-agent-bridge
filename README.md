Let an AI agent drive the Microsoft Edge you already have open, on the tab you are looking at.

Playwright, Puppeteer and Selenium launch a clean profile. That profile has none of your cookies, so
company SSO fails, bot checks fire, and anything behind a corporate VPN is out of reach. Edge Agent
Bridge attaches to your running browser instead. Your session, your extensions and your logged-in
state are all still there, and input goes in as trusted Chrome DevTools Protocol events rather than
synthetic clicks a page can tell apart.

Three surfaces sit on one local daemon: an MCP server for agent clients, a CLI, and a Python API.

Everything here is tested against Microsoft Edge. The extension is plain MV3 and the daemon speaks
ordinary CDP, so other Chromium browsers ought to work, but none are covered by the test suite and
none are claimed.

---

## Install

```bash
pip install edge-agent-bridge
```

Python 3.10 or newer. No third-party packages, at install time or at runtime.

Then install the companion extension directly from the
**[Microsoft Edge Add-ons store](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/agent-browser-bridge/dfkieodkfepoidihjapiggpjmfapanpd)** (**Agent Browser Bridge**), or load it unpacked while you're developing:

```bash
edge-bridge extension open     # opens the bundled extension directory
```

Turn on **Developer mode** at `edge://extensions`, click **Load unpacked**, and pick that
directory. Start the daemon and verify Edge connected:

```bash
edge-bridge daemon start
edge-bridge daemon status
```

```text
Daemon: running on 127.0.0.1:18999 (PID 24188)
Extension: 2.0.1 (connected)
```

CLI commands and Python's `with Edge()` start the daemon on first use if it isn't running, but
`daemon start` brings the extension online right away.

---

## Wire it into an agent

```bash
edge-bridge setup
```

That detects the MCP clients on your machine and registers the server with each one. Claude Code,
Cursor, Windsurf, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI and VS Code are covered. JSON config files are backed up
before they're touched, and a file that doesn't parse is left alone and reported.

To see the config without writing anything:

```bash
edge-bridge mcp-config --client claude
edge-bridge mcp-config --client cursor
```

The server speaks stdio JSON-RPC and exposes 29 tools, all prefixed `edge_` so they don't collide
with Playwright MCP in a mixed setup. [`docs/agent-guide.md`](docs/agent-guide.md) is written for
the agent rather than for you: snapshot first, act by ref, re-snapshot after navigation.

---

## Snapshot and refs

The agent reads the page as a tree of roles, names and current values, each interactive node
carrying a short id:

```text
$ edge-bridge snapshot
tab 1459 "Files - Example App" http://localhost:8080/files
page "Files - Example App" url=http://localhost:8080/files
- heading "Files" level=1
- textbox "Search" [e1] value=""
- button "Upload" [e2]
- file "Choose file" [e3] hidden
- table "Files"
  - row "12080 spec.pdf 2026-09-01" [e4]
    - button "Open" [e5]
```

Every action that takes a target accepts one of those refs, so `click e5` hits the button that was
actually named in the tree. A ref that no longer resolves returns `stale_ref`, and a ref from a
snapshot taken before the last navigation returns `stale_snapshot`. Neither one silently clicks
something else, which is the failure mode that makes text matching unusable on dense pages.

Values come back too, which is what makes "fill in the rest of this form" work: the agent can see
which fields you already filled. Passwords are masked. Hidden `input[type=file]` nodes are listed
anyway and tagged `hidden`, because upload buttons almost always hide the real input. Inside an
iframe a ref carries its frame, as in `f31e1`, including cross-origin frames.

---

## Python

```python
from edge_agent_bridge import Edge

with Edge() as browser:
    snap = browser.snapshot()
    print(snap["text"])

    browser.fill("e1", "spec")
    browser.click("e5")
    browser.wait(text="Opened")
    print(browser.console())
```

The daemon starts on first use. `Edge` pins itself to the tab of its first result, so a later call
can't drift onto a different tab because you switched windows in the meantime. Methods return the
raw result dict and never raise on a failed action: check `success`, read `code` and `error`.

---

## Command line

```bash
edge-bridge snapshot                      # tree with refs; --full adds static text
edge-bridge elements                      # interactive nodes with coordinates
edge-bridge click e5                      # ref, CSS selector or visible text
edge-bridge fill e1 "AI agents"
edge-bridge type "slow typing" --delay 30 # per-key events, for autocomplete widgets
edge-bridge key Enter
edge-bridge select e6 --label 日本語
edge-bridge upload e3 C:/tmp/spec.pdf
edge-bridge wait --text Opened
edge-bridge wait --idle                   # no in-flight requests; ignores WebSockets
edge-bridge screenshot out.jpg --of e4
edge-bridge console                       # console output, exceptions, dialogs
edge-bridge nav https://example.com
edge-bridge new https://example.com --group Agent
edge-bridge close --tab 1459
edge-bridge batch '[{"action":"click","target":"e5"},{"action":"sleep","ms":50},{"action":"fill","target":"e1","text":"spec"}]'
edge-bridge session start               # prints sessionToken=<uuid>; --new always mints
edge-bridge session status --session <uuid>
edge-bridge session stop --session <uuid>
edge-bridge click e5 --session <uuid>   # session pin; --tab is a one-shot override
edge-bridge click e5 --no-fallback      # disable the ref→text→scan→coords ladder
```

`--json` prints the raw result as a single line and sets the exit code: 0 on success, 1 when the
action failed, 2 when the daemon is unreachable, 3 on a usage error. `--no-highlight` turns off the
ring drawn around the element about to be acted on.

Each CLI call pays roughly 600 ms of Python startup. For anything repetitive use MCP, the Python
API, or the REPL, which reuses one connection:

```bash
edge-bridge repl
```

```text
Edge Agent Bridge REPL (port 18999). Type 'help' or action commands, 'exit' to quit.
edge> tab
[11.8ms] {"success": true, "tab": {"id": 1459, "title": "GitHub"}}
edge> click "Pull requests"
[14.2ms] {"success": true, "x": 380, "y": 96, "native": true}
```

## Security model

The trust boundary is your OS user account. Anything running as you can already read your files and
your browser profile, so the daemon does not try to defend against it.

- The daemon binds `127.0.0.1` only, and checks the `Host` header against the loopback names so a
  DNS rebinding attempt gets a 421 rather than a command.
- `/exec` requires the token written to the data directory at first start, mode 0600 on POSIX.
  A request carrying an `Origin` or `Sec-Fetch-*` header is refused outright, so a page you are
  browsing cannot reach the daemon even if it guesses the token.
- `/ws` requires an `Origin` beginning `chrome-extension://`, which keeps stray local clients off
  the extension channel. A second OS user on a shared machine could forge that header. If that is
  your situation, run `edge-bridge daemon start --require-pairing` and paste the token into the
  extension popup once; unpaired sockets are then rejected.
- WebSocket frames above 16 MB close the connection, and the socket carries a read timeout, so a
  local client cannot make the daemon buffer without bound or pin a worker thread forever.
- Nothing leaves the machine. There is no telemetry and no outbound request of any kind.

`eval` runs arbitrary JavaScript in the page, with your session. It is meant to be there, and it is
the reason to think about which agent you hand this to. Actions that destroy state need an explicit
tab id: `tab_close` without one is an error rather than a guess.

The extension asks for `debugger`, which is what makes input trusted and screenshots possible.
While it is attached, Edge shows its "is debugging this browser" bar. That bar is a Chromium policy
and cannot be dismissed from an extension.

## Measured benchmarks

Against live Edge tabs, from `tests/e2e/test_benchmark.py`. These are one machine's numbers;
the timings move with the host, so the suite treats them as advisory and gates on the
correctness assertions instead. `EDGE_BRIDGE_BENCH_STRICT=1` makes the timings gate too.

| Gate | What | Conditions | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| BM-01 | WebSocket latency | 200 sequential calls | P50 9.09 ms, P95 14.35 ms |
| BM-02 | Action batching | 50 ops batched against sequential | 7.9x, 140 ms against 1103 ms |
| BM-03 | Native click burst | 100 rapid CDP clicks | 100/100 with `isTrusted: true` |
| BM-04 | Typing integrity | 55 chars of Unicode, symbols and Japanese | byte-exact in 216 ms |
| BM-05 | CSS `:hover` cascade | multi-tier pure CSS dropdown | `sub1` then `sub2` opened, target clicked |
| BM-06 | CDP mouse drag | 300 px over 15 steps | dropped in 612 ms |
| BM-07 | DOM scanner | 3,000 synthetic elements | 2,253 interactive found in 134.8 ms |
| BM-08 | Screenshot | viewport capture and base64 decode | 111.2 ms average, 99.8 KB |
| BM-09 | Tab query | open tabs and active tab id | 12 tabs in 11.9 ms |

```bash
python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_benchmark.py -q -s
```

---

## Development

```bash
python -m pytest -q -m "not e2e"   # hermetic, no browser needed
python -m pytest -q -m e2e         # drives a real Edge
python scripts/build_extension.py  # syncs the manifest version, zips to dist/
```

The hermetic suite runs a real daemon against a fake extension over a real WebSocket, so it covers
the wire protocol without Edge installed. CI runs both suites on Windows, Linux and macOS.
Releases are automated, see [`docs/release.md`](docs/release.md).
